**Devil May Cry 5** is a Hack n' Slash game where it follows the story of *DMC*. Where **Vergil**, in the pursuit of power, sacrificed everything just to become stronger, and for **Dante**, **Vergil's** younger brother, tries to stop him.

In **Devil May Cry 5**, there are four playable characters. Those Characters are **Dante**, **Nero**, **Vergil**, and **V**. All four have different movesets and combos, but let's take a look at **Dante** first.

**Dante** as you can see, has an entire arsenal of guns, swords, a motorcycle, a cowboy hat, four different guns, a huge sword, 3 sticks that can be formed into a bo staff, and a set of armor that is placed on his feet and hands that specializes in close hand combat.

**Dante's**
main weapons are his sword, and his two pistols named *Ebony* and *Ivory*.

**Sin Devil Trigger**

Dante has a special move called **Sin Devil Trigger**, hee transforms into this demon like form and gets stronger just like any power up. In the game, you can only use it when you have added to your **Sin Devil Trigger** bar by fighting other demons.
