In Devil May Cry 5, there are four playable characters. Those Characters are Dante, Nero, Vergil, and V. All four have different movesets and combos, but let's take a look at Dante first.

Dante as you can see, has an entire arsenal of guns, swords, a motorcycle, a cowboy hat, four different guns, a huge sword, and a set of armor that is placed on his feet and hands that specializes in close hand combat.
