**Dante** as you can see, has an entire arsenal of guns, swords, a motorcycle, a cowboy hat, four different guns, a huge sword, and a set of armor that is placed on his feet and hands that specializes in close hand combat.

**Dante's**
main weapons are his sword, and his two pistols named *Ebony* and *Ivory*.

**Sin Devil Trigger**

Dante has a special move called **Sin Devil Trigger**, hee transforms into this demon like form and gets stronger just like any power up. In the game, you can only use it when you have added to your **Sin Devil Trigger** bar by fighting other demons.
